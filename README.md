# iOS-MiLight-Controller
An iOS Controller for MiLight Wifi Connected Bulbs. 


This is nowhere near complete. I decided to put this in a repo because there were no other obj-c versions of this code. I basically rewrote a Java Program I found that did something similar. My only interest was having the blue light turn on when my alarm went off. Unfortunately, I abandoned the project on iOS because Apple's background tasks api is basically nonexistant. This required me to keep the screen from idling which was not what I wanted. I plan on rewriting this in Node for my Raspberry Pi. Please feel free to contribute and I will update if there is interest.
